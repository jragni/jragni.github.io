                    Recently graduating from the <em> University of California, Riverside</em> with a <strong><em>B.S. Mechanical Engineering</em></strong>,
                    Jhensen Ray Agni is currently working as a Systems Engineer for the Naval Surface Warface Center in Corona. At a young age, Jhensen was exposed to the various cartoons and video games, such as Iron Man, Halo, and Zoids which has fueled his imagination and passion for
                    science and engineering. After completing courses in Engineering Design, Robotics and Mechatronics while attending university, he realized his childhood dreams of building robots was only limited by his imagination (and Physics!). Today, Jhensen is working towards becoming a
                    Software Engineer in order to continuously grow and learn every aspect that would supplement his robotics dream. <br>
                    When Jhensen isn't working to become the next Tony Stark, he enjoys: 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Bodybuilding/Powerlifting </li>
                        <li> Swimming </li>
                        <li> Real Estate Investing</li>
                        <li> Foodie-ing </li>
                        <li> Airsofting </li>
                        <li> Self-Development and Personal Transformation</li>
                        <li>Reading</li>
                    </ul>
                    Jhensen is interseted in anything that allows to become present in the moment!
